Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA:",
	        "rationale": "Let's think step by step. One-tenth of the time, no one reappears, so there have been 100 / 10 = <<100/10=10>>10 times no one has reappeared.\nOne-fifth of the time, two people reappear, so there have been 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20 times 2 people have reappeared.\nIn those 20 times, 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 people have reappeared in all.\nThus, there have been 100 - 10 - 20 = <<100-10-20=70>>70 times one person has reappeared.\nTherefore, over 100 acts, 70 + 40 = 100 people have reappeared in all.",

Daisy and Rose each have 2 legs so between them, they have 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 legs\nThere are 24 legs in the pool and 4 belong to Daisy and Rose so there are 24-4 = <<24-4=20>>20 legs in the pool\nDogs have 4 legs and there are 20 legs in the pool so there are 20/4 = 5 dogs in the pool",
