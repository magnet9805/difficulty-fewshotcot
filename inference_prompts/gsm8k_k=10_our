Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\nA:",

If Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.\nThe number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nOut of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals.",

Charlie's steps for 3 kilometers is 5350 x 2 = <<5350*2=10700>>10700 steps were made when he run twice the field.\nSince he has run half of the field 5350 / 2 = <<5350/2=2675>>2675 steps were made when he runs half of the 3-kilometer field.\nTherefore, Charlie was able to make 10700 + 2675 = <<10700+2675=13375>>13375 steps for the 2 and a half run around the field.",

The sum of the ratio is 1+1+3 = 5, therefore each part is 1500/5 = 300 stickers\nSam got 3 parts for a total of 3*300 = <<3*300=900>>900 stickers\nHe gave two-thirds of this which is 900*(2/3) = <<900*(2/3)=600>>600 stickers to Andrew\nAndrew had one part already, which is 1*300 = <<1*300=300>>300\nAndrew now has a total of 300+600 = <<300+600=900>>900 stickers.",

If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA:",

First find the total amount of fertilizer the horses produce per day: 5 gallons/horse * 80 horses = <<5*80=400>>400 gallons\nThen multiply the number of acres of farmland by the number of gallons per acre to find the total amount of fertilizer needed: 400 gallons/acre * 20 acres = <<400*20=8000>>8000 gallons\nThen divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer produced per day to find the number of days needed to collect fertilizer: 8000 gallons / 400 gallons/day = <<8000/400=20>>20 days\nThen divide the total number of acres Janet needs to cover by the number of acres she can cover per day to find how many days it takes her to cover them all: 20 acres / 4 acres/day = <<20/4=5>>5 days\nThen add the time to collect the fertilizer to the time to spread it to find the total time: 5 days + 20 days = <<5+20=25>>25 days",
